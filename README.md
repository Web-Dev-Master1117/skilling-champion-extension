# MVP Docs & Learn Champion extension

This extension adds a ***Copy link address with CreatorID*** item to your Browser on suitable sites.
It also ensures that the CreatorID is correctly added to the URL, so you don't have to worry about whether the URL already contains a query.
It provides the option to make English URL "language neutral" by removing "en-us" - this will enable most Microsoft sites to detect the preferred language of the user and serve the content in that language.

## Options

After you have installed the extension, please specify your CreatorIDs within the extension options. 
You can also check "Make English URLs language neutral" to make your links more friendly to a global audience.
